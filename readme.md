# onephrase_tech
There will be a description of a project. 
For now you can read a joke generated by chatGPT:

`Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because the light attracts bugs!`

*** Actually you won't be able to deploy it yourself, because the code has lots of connections with other services
and has some specific business logic*** 

## Establishing on a server (for my own use)
1. git clone {link to the repo}
2. cd onephrase_tech
3. Run command `touch ./log/app.log`
4. Run command `touch .env`
5. Fill .env with creds
6. Run command `touch google_creds.json`
7. Fill google_creds
8. docker-compose up --build -d
9. PROFIT!

## For local development
8. docker-compose -f dc_develop.yml up --build
